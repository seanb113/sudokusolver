Write a function that will solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value 0 representing an unknown square.

The Sudokus tested against your function will be "easy" (i.e. determinable; there will be no need to assume and test possibilities on unknowns) and can be solved with a brute-force approach.
